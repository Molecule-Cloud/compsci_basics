# Fibonacci and Merge Sort Project

## Overview
This project provides implementations of two fundamental algorithms: the Fibonacci sequence and Merge Sort. These algorithms are written in Ruby and demonstrate basic principles of recursion, iteration, and sorting techniques.

## Introduction
This project contains:
- An implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, which generates a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- An implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

## Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1.

### Implementation
The `fibonacci.rb` file contains both iterative and recursive implementations of the Fibonacci sequence.


# Example usage
puts fibs(8) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
